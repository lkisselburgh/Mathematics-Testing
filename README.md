## Details
The purpose of this app is to assist students with understanding math formulas. Some calculators compute a specific type of calculation for the user and also explain why the answer is what it is.

## Contributing
- We have lots of opportunities available for NOVICE to ADVANCED programmers. Contributions range from developing new math programs to developing graphing calculators and other more complex tasks!
- Be sure to refer to [IDEAS.md](https://github.com/Kyle-P/Mathematics/blob/master/IDEAS.md). This is where all our ideas and available work will be hosted. This is **where most of the available coding tasks will be.** Other programming tasks may involve the GUI, but most other opportunities can be found in the issues section of this repository.
- Check the [issues section](https://github.com/Kyle-P/Mathematics/issues) to help fix bugs and manage the project.
- Reading this file is a requirement in order to begin contributing: https://github.com/Kyle-P/Mathematics/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md. Please pay special attention to how to format your pull requests, issues, etc.

## Future Plan
- Create a GUI
- Bring all this work together into a desktop, online, and mobile app!
